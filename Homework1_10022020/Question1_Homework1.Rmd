# Question 1

## Objective 

The goal of this problem is to find the inverse CDF of the given density:

$$ f_X(x) = exp(x - e^x)$$

This will be done by creating an algorithm to simulate the standard extreme value distribution.
In order to find the distribution of the given density, i first find the CDF of the density by integrating the equation above:
$$F_x(x) = -e^{-e^{x}}$$
And then take the inverse of the equation:
$$F_x^{-1}(x) = ln(-ln(-x))$$

```{r functions}
n <- 1000 #sample number
U1 <- runif(n,0,1) #Random Number Generator, numbers are evenly distributed between 0 and 1
f <- function(x){exp(x - exp(x))}#the standard extreme value distribution density function
q <- function(U1){-log(-log(U1))}#inverse of the standard extreme value distribution density function, run uniform data through (U1)
#histogram of simulated data
hist(q(U1), prob = TRUE, main = "Standard Extreme Value Distibution", ylim = c(0, 1), xlab = "Variable", ylab ="Density")
x <- seq(min(q(U1)), max(q(U1)), 0.01)
lines(x,f(x), col = "blue") #density curve of f(x)

# Question 2

The objective of question 2 is to develop an algorithm to simulate the Rayleigh distribution. This will be in the form of a function with two inputs: the sample size as n and the scale parameter as $\sigma$.
The Rayleigh distribution has a density of;
$$f(x) = \frac{x}{\sigma^2}exp(-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2})$$
Integrating density:
$$F_x(x) = -exp(-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2})$$
Inverse of the CDF (of the given density function) is:
$$F^{-1}(x,\sigma) = \sigma\sqrt{-2ln(1 - x)}$$

```{r}
#CDF for the Rayleigh distribution
r <- function(n,s){
  u <- runif(n)
  x <- s*sqrt(-2*log(1-u))
  return(x)
}
#par(mfrow=c(1,2))
#Check normality
qqnorm(r(1000,1))
hist(r(1000,1), prob = TRUE)
#qqline(f(1000,1),lwd=2,col=2)
#
