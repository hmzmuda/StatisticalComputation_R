# Question 1

## Objective 

The goal of this problem is to find the inverse CDF of the given density:

$$ f_X(x) = exp(x - e^x)$$

This will be done by creating an algorithm to simulate the standard extreme value distribution.
<!-- CDF is for continuous random variables -->
For this we will use the EVD Function is R to make our distribution, which is a standard extreme value distribution, and evaluate the distribution using the inverse CDF approach.
```{r}
X = revd(1000, 0, 1)
```
