# Question 1

## Objective 

The goal of this problem is to find the inverse CDF of the given density:

$$ f_X(x) = exp(x - e^x)$$

This will be done by creating an algorithm to simulate the standard extreme value distribution.
<!-- CDF is for continuous random variables -->
For this we will use a normal distribution based on the equation above and then use inverse CDF approach, simulate the standard extreme value distribution.

To use the inverse CDF approach, we must first find the inverse of the density function, which is;

```{r variables}
u <- 0
B <- 1
n <- 1000 #sample number
U1 <- runif(n, 0, 1) #Random Number Generator, numbers are evenly distributed between 0 and 1
```

```{r functions}
f <- function(x){x - exp(x)}#the standard extreme value distribution density function
q <- function(U1){u - B * log(-log(U1))}#inverse of the standard extreme value distribution density function
#histogram of simulated data
hist(q(U1), prob = TRUE, main = "Standard Extreme Value Distibution", ylim = c(0,0.6), xlab = "Variable", ylab ="Density")
x <- seq(0, 1, 0.01)
lines(density(q(U1))) #density curve of f(x)
box()
```


```{r}

```
